        "Once a new member has used the link to access the discord they will automatically be given the role <@630806434451554305> and a welcome message from the bot will ask them to introduce themselves. The <@630806434451554305> role will limit what the new person can see to 3 rooms, <#630490180478042155>, <#630808509474144307> and <#630747807577538570>.\n\n" +
        "Please keep an eye on <#634526862458224654> for new members, once they have filled out all the information and you are happy they arenâ€™t a troll you can assign them the RS3 or OSRS role which will unlock the rest of the server.
