By doing this we lessen the chance of trolls joining on multiple accounts in order to cause trouble and spam hate.\n\n" +
        "Once a new member has used the link to access the discord they will automatically be given the role <@&630806434451554305> and a welcome message from the bot will ask them to introduce themselves. The <@&630806434451554305> will limit what the new person can see to 3 rooms, <#635250830114553856>, <#630808509474144307> and <#630747807577538570>.\n\n"+
        "Please keep an eye on <#630747807577538570> for new members, once they have filled out all the information you will see a ticket at the top of the server, read through the information and when you are happy they arenâ€™t a troll you can assign them the <@&630765616697049088> or <@&630765530030014476> roles (remember to check the forums to see that they have posted). \n\n" +
        "You will then need to manually assign the <@&639459046340165652> role this will unlock our more social rooms such as <#630461746070421515>, <#639434368963837953> and <#638367697519902730>. Then click on the :x: to close the ticket.\n\n"+
        "Once the <@&639459046340165652> role has been assigned the bot <@159985870458322944> will begin to track how many messages each individual has sent, after a roughly 30 minute conversation (25+ messages) you will see a notification in <#642555733875097610> that an individual has achieved level 3, at this point you can assign the <@&642636421185929218> role and it will unlock the rest of the server.")
